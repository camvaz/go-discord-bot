# go-discord-bot

This is a rough implementation of a discord server I built during a summer while learning the Go programming language. Features include:

1. Keeps track of users in a voice channel in-memory through a map.
2. Simple command responses.
3. Sound integrations. I wanted to track specific users joining and leaving a voice channel so the bot could greet them and say goodbye.
4. A shell script that can be used to spin-up EC2 instances with this program.

## Scope

This is just a project built for fun, but I think it has strong foundations to build discord bots that are really efficient.
Feel free to contribute. I think that this could be the first steps to building a cli that generates discord bot projects in golang with this architecture.

Enjoy!
